# leragon
most peak docker manager built to suit my needs.

this docker manager assumes all docker containers starting with the same name are part of one big project.

## backstory
This project exists because I was used to [Laragon](https://laragon.org) php manager idk something made by someone go research it if you want to find out. That project was so peak the moment i switched to [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) I was devastated to find out it didnt exist for linux and I had to use docker (I didn't have to use docker but since I had some experience with it I decided on that). The only good docker manager I ever used was [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) and it is paid and [Yacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces) fucking sucks

This project is far from finished or even usable. I will do a little todo list below:

| ✓ | Task |
|---|------|
| ✓ | global -> projects |
| ✓ | projects -> containers |
| ☐ | projects -> images |
| ☐ | projects -> networks |
| ☐ | projects -> volumes |
| ☐ | projects -> logs |
| ☐ | projects -> settings |
| ☐ | images |
| ☐ | networks |
| ☐ | volumes |
| ☐ | logs |
| ☐ | settings |
| ☐ | Auth |
| ☐ | Installation Script |

## usage
**AS I SAID DONT USE THIS** 

but if you do you can use docker-compose. Also the dockerfile needs `DOCKER_GID` paramater so it can access `docker.sock` but you can figure that out
